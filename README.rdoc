= LinuxFortune

* http://github.com/srejbi/linux_fortune_gem

== DESCRIPTION:

Provides a wrapper to the 'fortune' program on linux (and unix /parameters
might differ/) platforms. As most (good) web servers are running on these
platforms, a 'local' fortune gem seemed like a good idea to play around and
discover ruby gem development through a practical example.

If you need a network-based fortune service, though, you might want to check out
lacco's ruby_fortunes at http://github.com/lacco/ruby-fortunes

== FEATURES:

* allows generating messages from all or specific fortune database modules
* possibility to generate short (up to LinuxFortune.short_length characters) messages

== ISSUES:

* LinuxFortune.long = true seem to have no effect due to issue with fortune (?)

== SYNOPSIS:

To use it:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'linux_fortune'
  f = LinuxFortune.generate("chucknorris")
  puts f.body

To search fortunes:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'linux_fortune'
  fs = LinuxFortune.search("develop")
  puts "#{fs.size} hits:"
  fs.each do |f|
    puts f.source
    puts f.body
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* fortune must be installed, with some fortune db modules

== INSTALL:

* gentoo: 
  sudo emerge fortune
* ubuntu, debian:
  apt-get install fortune
